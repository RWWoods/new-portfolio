        I am a recent graduate from the University of Pennsylvania Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, mySql, Nodejs, Jest, MongoDb, Express, and React. I have worked both individually and within unique groups to create and deploy full stack applications.

        Before I started to learn software development, I worked at Apple for five years working my way up to a Genius role technician. I worked daily with people from all walks of life, and learned valuable interpersonal skills that help me work with and get along with almost anyone; furthermore, I developed excellent troubleshooting skills and familiarity with computer and mobile hardware and repairs.

        I graduated from Kalamazoo College in 2018 with a degree in Classics, after following my passion for language and fascination with the ancient world. I enjoyed the puzzle-like aspects of translating Latin and Ancient Greek poetry and found a love for communication.
